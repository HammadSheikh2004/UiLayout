    <string name="home_desc">Property descriptions can make all the difference in making — or breaking — a future sale. Their incredible importance makes them a must on any listing, and the ability to craft quality descriptions is an essential skill for any real estate agent.

Well-written property descriptions hook the buyer and answer important questions and can be used in marketing collateral like property websites. They highlight desirable features, mention brand-name appliances, and summarize any upgrades or renovations. Because of their ability to persuade, property descriptions make an agent’s overall job much easier. </string>
